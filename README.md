# my_nvim_config

this is someone's nvim config,
i just upload to github to save these config for like... if i reinstall my os, i can git clone it

NOTE!!!!!!!

- this it not my config, 
- i just copy from someone and custom it for it more comfortable with me
- do not copy the plugin directory.

Install plugins:
In your nvim (normal mode), type:
```
:PackerSync
```
I have installed pynvim with these command:

1.
```
python -m venv ~/.venvs/nvim
```
2.
```
~/.venvs/nvim/bin/pip install pynvim
```
